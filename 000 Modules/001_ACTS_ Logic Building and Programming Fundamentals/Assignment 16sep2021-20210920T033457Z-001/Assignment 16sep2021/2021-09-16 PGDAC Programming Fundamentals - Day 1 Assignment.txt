Write algorithm and/or flow chart for following problems.
Test their correctness by doing dry run with given sample inputs.


1. Given a positive integer N, find all factors of N.
For example:
N = 12
Factors = 1 2 3 4 6 12
N = 5
Factors = 1 5


2. Given a positive integer N, find its reverse.
For example:
N = 534
Reverse = 435
N = 5
Reverse = 5


3. Find first N terms of a Fibonacci Series. In Fibonacci series the next term is the sum of the previous two terms.
First two terms of the series are 1 and 1. Hence, the series with 6 terms would be
1 1 2 3 5 8


4. Find sum of all numbers between two positive integers N and M, including N and M.
For example:
N = 3
M = 7
Sum = 25 (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7)


5. Find prime numbers between two positive integers N and M, including N and M.
For example:
N = 3
M = 10
Prime Numbers = 3 5 7


6. Find the first digit in a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 32
First Digit = 3


7. Find the sum of all digit of a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 3245
Sum of digits = 14 (3 + 2 + 4 + 5)


8. Find the sum of all digit of a integer (both positive and negative).
For example:
Number = -3245
Sum of digits = 14 (3 + 2 + 4 + 5)
Number = 12
Sum of digits = 3 (1 + 2)


9. Find the product of all digit of a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 312
Sum of digits = 6 (3 x 1 x 2)


10. Given a positive integer N, check if its palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that is same as its reverse.
For example:
Number = 32
Not a palindrome. (Reverse is 23 and not same as 32)
Number = 545
A palindrome. (Reverse is 545 and not same as 545)
