Total :- 60 minutes
50 minutes :- Data Structures and algorithms
10 minutes :- Basic Java Questions
1. Given an array of n consecutive elements , and one number is missing , how will you find it? What will be the corresponding time complexity?
2. What is data structure, give real life example.
3. What are linear and non linear data structures?
4. Suppose you have been deployed to a project where you have to create your own data structure, how will you implement it, what operations it must possess , how will you normalise it, which algorithms will you use ?
5. How have you used normalisation in your database? Give example in detail and if yes How?
6. What is Divide and Conquer Strategy?
7. Was told to write bubble sort code and asked several questions about time complexities.For eg:- What is the min TC? What is the max TC?How many number of swaps for each pass.
8. 0/1 Knapsack Problem from Dynamic Programming.(Was asked using a real time scenario) Not directly.
