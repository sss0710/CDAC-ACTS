	Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  Output: arr[] = {6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3} - Alternate minimum and maximum elements 
A. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-maximum-minimum-form/
Q5. Only approach and not coding - How to get number of duplicate lines/sentences in a file

    ES5, ES6, new features of ES6. Rest and spread operators, arrow functions etc etc..
Q5. Asked to code - Merge 2 arrays removing duplicates and in a sorted manner
    For example, if {7, -5, 3, 8, -4, 11, -19, 21} and {6, 13, -7, 0, 11, -4, 3, -5} are two unsorted integer arrays then     sorted merged array without duplicates will be {-19, -7, -5, -4, 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 21}.
