1. Create a script that creates the firefox process and then stop the firefox process using SIGKILL sign

firefox &

var=$(pidof firefox)

for i in $var
	do
		kill -9 $i
	done

2. Create a script that takes the process name and displays it's pid? - It should throw the error if process name enetered is incorrect or doesnt exist on the system
3. Create a script that takes a pid and displays the process name
ps -p <pid> | grep -v "TTY" | awk '{print $NF}'

4. Create a script that asks for a command name - then displays it's absolute path and the runs it and displays the output?
5. Perform Q1 - change: script will ask for multiple process names this time. User enters multiple processes(comma separeted) and then system initiates and then kills those processes. eg: firefox,vi,top
6. File1	File2
	cat		dog
	mat		car
	dog		poor
	note	man
	bag		bat
	bat		ball
Create a script that tells if the items present under file2 are there in file1 or not. Need to parse through each item.
