[task3_lab]
Create a script that asks for username and display its home directory only if it's user id is greater than 1000 and less than 1003

[root@localhost scripts]#  cat ./task3_lab.sh
#!/bin/bash
#Create a script that asks for username and display its home directory only if it's user id is greater than 1000 and less than 1003

read -p "Provide username: " usr

##Here we have to find the userid and see if it is greater than 1000 and less than 1003

uid=$(cat /etc/passwd | grep "$usr" | awk -F':' '{print $3}')
homedir=$(cat /etc/passwd | grep "$usr" | awk -F':' '{print $6}')

if [[ $uid > 1000 && $uid < 1003 ]]
        then
                echo "$homedir"
        else
                echo "UID does not fall in given range"

---------

To see IP address of the machine

ifconfig
ip a

ens33: check the IP in ens33 interface

If you dont have the IP address
Run the following command - This command will fetch an IP address from your local DHCP server
#dhclient -v

If you want to see that - is your linux machine connected to internet, then fire the following command:

#nslookup google.com

[task4_lab]
Create a script that asks for a random number from the user.
Check if that number matches any UID in the Linux machine.
If it does, display the username and it's shell
If it doesn't then increment that number by 10 and display the incremented number?
